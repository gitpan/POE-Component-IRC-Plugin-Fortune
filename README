POE-Component-IRC-Plugin-Fortune

The module brings all the joys of the C<fortune> *nix program to IRC.
You B<do> need to have the actual program installed. Future versions may
incorporate the L<Fortune> module to be used instead; give me a shout
if you would like that.

This module is a L<POE::Component::IRC> plugin which uses
L<POE::Component::IRC::Plugin> for its base.
It accepts input from public channel events, C</notice> messages as well
as C</msg> (private messages); although that can be configured at will.

INSTALLATION
